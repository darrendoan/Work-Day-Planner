# Work-Day-Planner

## Description
In this week's challenge, we were tasked with creating a work day planner. This challenge required us to apply our understanding of bootstrap, Jquery and dayJS.

## Usage
Ever had a busy day full of appointments and meetings? Ever felt like it was too much to remember? Well this handy work day planner is what you need! This planner will make your life super easy! It changes colours based on the current time and based on the current hour of the planner. Grey means the time block has past, red means you are currently in that hour and green means you havent past that time yet. You can also save your meetings and/or appointments simply by clicking on a block, writing whatever you need down and clicking the save button. It even stays if you refresh the page! WHATTTT! so cool. 

Anyway, you can access the webpage through this link:
